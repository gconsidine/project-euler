PROJECT EULER

Problems 1 through 17 I completed several months ago.  Before that, I hadn't
heard of Project Euler, and I didn't have much experience with Python.  So
Project Euler became a way for me to brush up on my math and learn a 
new language at the same time.

As the problems increased in difficulty, I wrote out (sometimes long-winded)
explanations at the bottom of the file containing the solution to give
some insight into my thought process.

All problems are self-contained within a single file and solutions are printed
out to the terminal.
